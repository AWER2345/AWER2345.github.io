I'm Aidan Perras, a Computer Science student currently pursuing my education at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experiences at companies like Tableau, Amazon, and DocuSign, where I've had the privilege to apply and expand my knowledge in practical settings.

Within the realm of computer science, I have a special interest in network programming. Exploring the intricacies of how systems communicate and connect in the digital world has always intrigued me. 

Beyond my academic pursuits and coding adventures, I believe in giving back to the community. I'm an active member of the Computer Science Student Society (CSSS) at UBC, where I find immense satisfaction in helping my fellow students navigate the complexities of computer science education. Whether it's offering guidance, organizing workshops, or fostering a sense of camaraderie, I'm committed to assisting and supporting others on their academic journey. 

In my free time, I also indulge in two other passions: cooking and biking. Cooking allows me to unleash my creativity in the kitchen, while biking lets me explore the world and connect with nature.
