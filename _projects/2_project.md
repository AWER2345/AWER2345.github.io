• Designed a custom DSL with a team to take in user input and generate maps in Typescript.

• Implemented language features such as loops, recursion, function calls, and control flow to improve language
expressiveness for users.

• Used Google Maps API to display maps on a 2D canvas after converting from 3D for frontend in TypeScript.
